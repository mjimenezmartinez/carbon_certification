# Marketing of carbon certificates in agroforestry interventions
Is it worth, for German farmers introducing an agroforestry system, to sell carbon certificates as an additional source of income?

Typical decision analysis binary problem, consisting on planting rows of walnut trees in winter wheat-barley-rapeseed rotations. Walnut trees are managed with the dual-purpose of harvesting nuts and high-value timber. The intervention includes the integration of the farm into a carbon certification project.
The main aim of the model is to explore whether it is worth for farmers to participate in carbon market projects. For that reason, the input table includes farm size as a variable, whose minimum, maximum and median values have been estimated on official national statistics of Germany (DeSTATIS).
